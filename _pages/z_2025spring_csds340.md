# **CSDS340: Introduction to Machine Learning**

Xiaotian (Max) Han

Spring 2025, M/W 3:20–4:35 PM


## **Course Description**

This course provides an in-depth introduction to machine learning (ML) algorithms and their practical implementation. We will examine key learning settings, explore diverse algorithms, and learn how to implement and evaluate their performance. We will also discuss handling noise, missing values, and scalability challenges, as well as review common ML tools and libraries.


## **Required and Recommended Materials**

* 
* Research papers will be provided.
* Dive into Deep Learning, [https://d2l.ai/d2l-en.pdf](https://d2l.ai/d2l-en.pdf)  


## **Course Components & Grading Policy** 
*The grading policy is subject to minor change.*

Student's grades will be calculated according to the following components: 

* Paper Presentation (30%):
  * 20-min presentation on a research paper (30%)
* Class participation (10%)
  * Forms for the presentation (1% each, 10 in total)
* Final Project (60%):
  * A 2-page proposal (10%)
  * A 6-page final report (40%)
  * Project presentation (10%). 


Paper Presentation Format:
- Select a paper from the provided list
- 20-minute presentation on the selected paper
- 10-minute Q&A session
- Each student must present at least once
- Audience members will submit questions and rate the presenter using a provided form.


Final Project Format:
- 3 students in each group
- Select a topic related to LLMs
- Use ICLR2024 latex format for proposal and final report
- In-class presentation on the final project


Grading Criteria:
- Paper Presentation (30%):
   - Completeness and quality of the presentation (15%)
   - Average peer rating (15%)
- Class Participation (10%):
   - Forms submitted for each paper presentation (1% each, we will have over 10 presentations, you need to submit at least 10 forms)
- Final Project (60%):
   - Assessed the quality of the proposal, final report, and presentation.
